# Hotel-Booking-Revenue-Performance
Hotel revenue analytics report for quarter 1 2016.
The data i used was unstructured and was in csv format. I imported the tables into SQL server for analyzing and cleanzing.I joined the tables and i used datediff to calculate the date difference between the hotel booking startdate and enddate after which i multipled with the booking price to get the booking revenue. The total roomm capacity of the hotel was 117,000, total number of guest was 96,000, average length of stay was 5days. The report shows that hthe hotel had the highest booking during holiday and on business days. The most frequently booked room was normal rooms and conference rooms.I used PowerBi to visualized my report so that it would be well presented and understood.

# Tools
MsExcel, SQL server for analyzing and cleaning the data and PowerBi for Visualization of my results.
