# Hotel-Booking-Revenue-Performance
The data was collected from a hotel system and was in csv files. (Reservations, food requests, menu items, and rooms). For analysis and cleaning, I imported the tables into SQL Server in Azure Data Studio. I linked the tables and used datediff to determine the date difference between the start date and end date of the hotel booking, after which I multiplied by the booking fee to obtain the revenue from the booking. The hotel had a total room capacity of 117,000, a total of 96,000 guests, and a 5-day average stay. The research reveals that the hotel's occupancy rates were highest on business days and during holidays. Normal rooms and conference rooms were the most often reserved types of space. I illustrated my report using PowerBi so that it would be well presented and understood.
