# Hotel-Booking-Revenue-Performance
Hotel revenue analytics report for quarter 1 2016.
 The data i used was unstructured and was in csv format. I imported the tables into SQL server for analyzing and cleanzing.I joined the tables and i used datediff to calculate the date difference between the hotel booking startdate and enddate after which i multipled with the booking price to get the booking revenue.
